Add to Sensor class or develop a new class??

Separate Door Sensors or Add new Sensors ??

Hardware Design:
Use ds2406 device:  Add new device type
PIO-B is door sensor
PIO-A is door button control
gpio port connects to one-show multivibrator to generate a 1/2 second pulse
pulse drives a 2n3904 which drives a relay, which is connected across button

Class properties:
canOpen : door control is allowed
canClose:

Class methods:
getDoorState() : read door state
openDoor() : open door, only if 1) Alarm is OFF, 2) door is closed, 3)door control is enabled
closeDoor() : close door, only if 1) door is open, 2) canClose is TRUE
pressDoorButton() : generate short pulse to PIO-A
doorDidClose() : follow up check of PIO-B that door closed, then send message
doorDidOpen() : follow up
